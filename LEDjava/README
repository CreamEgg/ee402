A very quick example of setting the Beaglebone LED state in Java
 - Derek Molloy, Derek.Molloy@dcu.ie, www.derekmolloy.ie

To execute this example you need to have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed on the Beaglebone/Beaglebone Black. You can see my video at youtube.com/DerekMolloyDCU/ that explains how to do this.

The source for the example is in: /src/ee402/
as the class is in the package ee402

The binary is also here and is in: /bin/ee402/
To execute this, go to the directory /bin and type:

java ee402.BasicLEDExample [On/Off]
